# Computer Vision based Image Caption Generator on Flickr Dataset

This paper presents an image caption generator that uses advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques to automatically produce descriptive captions for images. The paper explains the methodology, implementation, and evaluation of the generator, which combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) for image feature extraction and a long short-term memory network (LSTM) for natural language processing1. The paper also discusses the applications and challenges of image captioning, as well as the future directions for improvement.

## Introduction

The project is about developing an image caption generator using advanced computer vision and deep learning techniques. The goal is to automatically generate descriptive captions for images, addressing the growing importance of image processing in various fields, such as object recognition and image categorization. The project uses the Flickr30k dataset, which contains 30,000 images, each associated with five captions. The project employs a CNN-LSTM model, which combines convolutional neural networks for image feature extraction and long short-term memory networks for natural language processing. The project evaluates the performance of the model using the BLEU score, a metric that measures the similarity between predicted and actual captions. The project also discusses the potential applications and implications of image captioning in the realms of social media and accessibility.
